                <p> Anna Nicole Smith (born Vickie Lynn Hogan; November 28, 1967 – February 8, 2007) was an American model, actress and television personality. Smith first gained popularity in Playboy magazine when she won the title of 1993 Playmate of the Year. She modeled for fashion companies, including Guess, H&M, Heatherette and Lane Bryant.
                Smith was born Vickie Lynn Hogan in 1967 in Houston, Texas and raised in Mexia, Texas. She was the daughter of Donald Eugene Hogan (1947–2009) and Virgie Mae Arthur (née Tabers; 1951-2018), who married on February 22, 1967 and divorced on November 4, 1969. She had five half siblings: Donna Hogan, David Tacker Jr., Donnie Hogan, Amy Hogan and Donald Hart. Smith was raised by her mother and an aunt. Smith's mother married Donald R. Hart in 1971, after which Smith changed her name from Vickie Hogan to Nikki Hart.

Smith attended Durkee Elementary School and Aldine Senior High School in Houston. When she was in the ninth grade, she was sent to live with her mother's younger sister, Kay Beall, in Mexia, Texas.[5] At Mexia High School, Smith failed her freshman year and dropped out of school during her sophomore year.[6][4] While working at Jim's Krispy Fried Chicken in Mexia, Smith met Billy Wayne Smith, a cook at the restaurant, and the couple married on April 4, 1985.</p>
